* ScrubberApp v2 *
* ************** *

A simple app that will scrub one list of numbers against another. Within
the program, the basic list of numbers is called the 'Number List' and
the list against which exclusion operation is perform is called the 'DND
List'.

SA can handle large lists of numbers. I've tested it for up to 2 x 4.5Mn
numbers succesfully. The custom run scripts (Windows / UNIX) found in
'test/' can be used for handling large files (> 4Mn total). The memory
value assigned can, of course, be increased for even larger files.

As should be obvious from the 'nbproject' folder this App has been
developed using the NetBeans IDE. Start NetBeans, add this project and
click run to build n' execute! :-)

* *************** *
* Why a Java App? *
* *************** *

This is much faster than a (MySQL) DB exclusion (outer join) operation.
Scrubbing two 4.5 Mn lists against each other took 37 seconds on my 2005
Macbook. Of those 37 seconds, it took 30 to just to load the data into
memory. A computer with faster I/O would do a lot better.

* ***************** *
* How does it work? *
* ***************** *

1) Load from files into array (long).
2) Sort (binary) both arrays.
3) Search (binary) for each number in 'Number list' in the 'DND list'.
4) Output result list.
