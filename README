* ScrubberApp v2 *
* ************** *

A simple app that will scrub one list of numbers against another. Within
the program, the basic list of numbers is called the 'Number List' and
the list against which exclusion operation is perform is called the 'DND
List'.

SA can handle large lists of numbers. I've tested it for up to 2 x 1.5M
numbers succesfully. Beyond that, it runs into the memory wall for
an App allowed by JVM. Haven't found a way around that yet, but
the current limit is acceptable for its use case.

As should be obvious from the 'nbproject' folder this App has been
developed using the NetBeans IDE. Start NetBeans, add this project and
click run to build n' execute! :-)
