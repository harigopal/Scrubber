* ScrubberApp v3 *
* ************** *

This is a simple app that will scrub a base list of numbers against
another list of numbers and (optionally) against a range of numbers
defined by their starting digits.

Within the program, the basic list of numbers is called the 'Number
List' and the list against which exclusion operation is performed is
called the 'Scrub List'. The range of numbers is referred to as the
'Scrub-Range List'.

SA can handle large lists of numbers. I've tested it for up to 2 x 4.5Mn
numbers succesfully. The custom run scripts (Windows / UNIX) found in
'test/' can be used for handling large files (> 4Mn total). The memory
value assigned can, of course, be increased for even larger files. Edit
those launch scripts should you run into a memory wall.

As should be obvious from the 'nbproject' folder this App has been
developed using the NetBeans IDE. Start NetBeans, add this project and
click run to build n' execute! :-)

* Why a Java App? *
* *************** *

This is much faster than a (MySQL) DB exclusion (outer join) operation.
Scrubbing two 4.5 Mn lists against each other took 37 seconds on my 2005
Macbook. Of those 37 seconds, it took 30 to just to load the data into
memory. A computer with faster I/O would do a lot better.

* ***************** *
* How does it work? *
* ***************** *

1) Load from files into array (long).
2) Sort (binary) both arrays.
3) Check if number falls within exclusion range (Optional step).
4) Search (binary) for each number in 'Number list' in the 'DND list'.
5) Output result list.
