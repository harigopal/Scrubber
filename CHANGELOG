| v2 |
------

  * Fixed a memory overflow error while loading files.
  * Fixed app crashing when non-numeric values are encountered in input.
      The app now displays a message that alerts the user to the
      presence of such values and asks that they be removed manually
      before attempting a 'scrub'.
